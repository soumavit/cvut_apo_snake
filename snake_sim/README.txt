Snake

This app was created by Vit Soumar as a semestral project for a computer architectures course at CTU FEE.

This is the version that can be run in a linux terminal. Its not optimal because its using the terminal as a simulated display,
but is was sufficent for the needs for the semestral project.
The files also arent sorted to folders by their function and only the code in the non-simulated version is documented, although the code is almost the same as this one.

Steps:
1) open up the terminal
2) set up a custom profile in the terminal
  2.1) set the font size to 1
  2.2) set character width to the same value as character height
3) select the profile in the terminal settings
4) run the program

In this simulated version, the keys:
    Q and E represent the rotating of the red knob and W represents the press of the red knob
    A and D represent the rotating of the green knob and S represents the press of the green knob
    Z and C represent the rotating of the blue knob and X represents the press of the blue knob
